        <h1>GitHub Merge Queue Appeal Outcome Closure: Post-Incident Follow-Up Template and Ownership Checklist (2026)</h1>
        <p class="meta">Published February 17, 2026 &middot; 11 min read</p>

        <p>Most teams have a denial-appeal path for merge queue incidents. Fewer teams have a reliable way to close that appeal and prevent the same exception request from returning next week. Without closure discipline, incidents are marked "done" while risky policy drift stays in place.</p>

        <p>This guide gives a practical <strong>appeal outcome closure workflow</strong> with a copy-paste <strong>post-incident follow-up template</strong>, explicit owners, UTC deadlines, and validation checkpoints.</p>

        <h2 id="why">1. Why appeal closure fails in practice</h2>

        <p>Appeal workflows usually fail at the final 10%. Teams decide "approve" or "deny" but skip hard closure artifacts. Later, nobody can prove whether baseline protections were restored on time or which action items were actually completed.</p>

        <div class="warn-box">
            <strong>Common failure mode:</strong> Final decision is posted in chat, not in PR timeline. Incident owner rotates off-call, follow-up actions remain ownerless, and the same bypass request reappears in the next incident.
        </div>

        <table class="mini-table">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Closure gap</th>
                    <th>Immediate impact</th>
                    <th>Later consequence</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>No explicit final state in PR</td>
                    <td>Ambiguous ownership</td>
                    <td>Reopened debate during next incident</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>No restored-protection proof</td>
                    <td>Bypass may remain active</td>
                    <td>Silent policy drift and audit risk</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>No follow-up deadlines</td>
                    <td>Action items slip</td>
                    <td>Repeated queue incidents from same root cause</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>No reviewer acknowledgment</td>
                    <td>Single-point blind spot</td>
                    <td>Weak governance quality over time</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h2 id="gate">2. Closure gate: required evidence before resolution</h2>

        <p>Do not mark an appeal closed unless all gate checks are satisfied. If one check is missing, keep status as <code>pending-closure</code> and assign the missing artifact owner immediately.</p>

        <div class="checklist">
            <strong>Closure gate checklist:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Final appeal outcome state recorded in PR timeline (<code>approved</code> / <code>denied</code> / <code>approved-with-conditions</code>).</li>
                <li>Decision rationale linked to evidence (logs, check runs, incident notes).</li>
                <li>Branch protection / merge queue baseline restoration confirmed with UTC timestamp.</li>
                <li>Follow-up actions captured with owner, due date, and validation criteria.</li>
                <li>Second reviewer or platform approver acknowledged closure comment.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>Tip:</strong> Treat closure as a distinct state transition, not a side note. Use an explicit marker like <code>Appeal-Closure-ID</code> in comments so future audits are searchable.
        </div>

        <h2 id="states">3. Outcome states and owner matrix</h2>

        <p>Use small, stable outcome states and fixed owners per state. This avoids relabeling confusion during handoff between incident commander and platform governance.</p>

        <table class="mini-table">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Outcome state</th>
                    <th>Primary owner</th>
                    <th>Required follow-up</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>approved</code></td>
                    <td>Incident commander</td>
                    <td>Document why approval was safe, define rollback expiry check</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>approved-with-conditions</code></td>
                    <td>Platform approver</td>
                    <td>Track conditional controls (time-box, extra checks, reviewer gate)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>denied</code></td>
                    <td>Platform approver</td>
                    <td>Confirm baseline restored and communicate acceptable next evidence</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>pending-closure</code></td>
                    <td>Delegated closure owner</td>
                    <td>Collect missing proof, post final closure comment before shift end</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h2 id="template">4. Copy-paste closure + follow-up template</h2>

        <p>Post this comment in the PR timeline immediately after final decision. Keep UTC format strict so downstream automation and audits remain machine-readable.</p>

        <h2 id="timeline">5. 24h / 7d / 30d follow-up cadence</h2>

        <p>One closure comment is not enough. Follow-up must be staged across short, medium, and longer windows to prevent repeated rollback exceptions.</p>

        <div class="checklist">
            <strong>24h checkpoint:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Verify no active emergency bypass remains.</li>
                <li>Confirm highest-risk follow-up action is completed or on-track.</li>
                <li>Update PR timeline with checkpoint note and owner signature.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="checklist">
            <strong>7d checkpoint:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Review whether similar incidents recurred with same root signal.</li>
                <li>Confirm policy/documentation updates merged and discoverable.</li>
                <li>Record if appeal volume dropped or escalations shortened.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="checklist">
            <strong>30d checkpoint:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Retrospective on governance quality (approval speed vs policy safety).</li>
                <li>Close long-tail actions or reassign with new due dates.</li>
                <li>Archive closure bundle with stable links for audit/review.</li>

        <h2 id="metrics">6. Metrics and anti-patterns</h2>

        <p>Track closure quality with a few metrics that are easy to enforce.</p>

            <strong>Anti-pattern to avoid:</strong> Closing incidents with "action items tracked elsewhere" but no direct PR references. This breaks traceability and inflates unresolved governance debt.

        <h2 id="faq">7. FAQ</h2>

        <h3>When is an appeal considered closed in merge queue incidents?</h3>
        <p>Close only after final decision, evidence links, protection restoration proof, and follow-up action ownership are all recorded in the PR timeline.</p>

        <h3>What must be included in a post-incident follow-up template?</h3>
        <p>At minimum: decision summary, rationale, evidence, protection-state verification, owner assignments, UTC deadlines, and measurable validation criteria.</p>

        <h3>Who should own closure versus follow-up?</h3>
        <p>Closure is typically owned by incident command or delegated closure owner; long-tail actions should be distributed to domain owners with governance review.</p>

        <h3>What if one action misses the due date?</h3>
        <p>Do not silently extend. Update the timeline with the missed checkpoint, reason, new owner and UTC deadline, then require reviewer acknowledgment.</p>
